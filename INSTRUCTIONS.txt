This project is only suppoted by Turbo C++. Since Turbo C++ is no more actively used and is quite outdated, so you have to take care of certain things.

Follow these steps:

1. Copy all files with extension '.h ' into Turbo C++ includes folder.

2. Also, you need to change the path to graphics provided by Turbo C++, i.e. the BGI folder.
For this, open all files and change the arguement of function initgraph(&gdriver, &gmode, <path to BGI folder>).
If the path to BGI folder of Turbo C++ is C:\TurboC3\BGI, then replace <path to BGI folder> by "c:\\turboc3\\bgi". So we would have something like this,

	initgraph(&gdriver, &gmode, "c:\\turboc3\\bgi");
	
Accordingly change this arguement to function initgraph.
